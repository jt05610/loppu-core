        tables:
            coils:
                - name: coil_1
                  desc: Coils are binary read/write registers. They are used to execute on/off functions on the target device
                  params:
                    - value:
                        type: int
                        desc: Writing 0 will write 0 to the device. Writing anything else will write 1.
                - name: coil_2
                  desc: They can also be parameter-less if you want
            discrete_inputs:
                - name: discrete_input_1
                  desc: Discrete inputs are binary read only registers
                - name: discrete_input_2
                  desc: Add a new one like this
            holding_registers:
                - name: holding_register_1
                  desc: Holding registers are 16-bit read/write registers. They are used to set variables on the device, and can execute a if desired
                  params:
                    - value:
                        type: int
                        desc: Whatever you write will be converted to a uint16
                - name: holding_register_2
                  desc: Add a new one like this
                  params:
                    - value:
                        type: int
                        desc: You technically don't need to include a parameter but you probably should
            input_registers:
                - name: input_register_1
                  desc: Input registers are 16-bit read only registers
                - name: input_register_2
